# Perfil

A platform for profiling public figures in Brazilian politics,
searching for weird patterns or figures with inconsistent politics paths
(changes in parties, unpopular law projects, high expenses on public money).

## Settings

To run the API, you must copy the `env-template` to a `.env` file and
edit it accordingly.

## Install

Starting the application:

```sh
$ docker-compose up
```

The API will be available at [`localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000) and the
notebooks at [`localhost:8888`](http://localhost:8888).
